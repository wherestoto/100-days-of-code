**Today's Progress**: Learned about cross-browser support for form placeholder properties, form handlers, best ways to organize files in a complex project with BEM, and learned some helpful command line & git properties I didn't know.

**Thoughts**: Glad to learn principles of organizing software project folders and code. I've been trying to innovate my own way of organzing, but BEM makes things much simpler. I'm definitley more comfortable dealing with local environments and the terminal.

### Day 13: June 8, 2021 
**Today's Progress**: Reorganized files in a project to improve downstream dev & stay DRY. It also let me practice using terminal & git commands from Day 12. I read & walked away forgetting zsh vs bash vs vim for the 2nd time.
